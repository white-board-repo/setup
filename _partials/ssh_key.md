## SSH Key

### Generation

We need to generate SSH keys which are going to be used by GitHub to authenticate you. You can think of it as a way to log in, but different from the well known username/password pair.

:warning: If you already generated keys that you already use with other services, you can skip this step.

Open a terminal and copy-paste this command, replacing the email with **yours** (the same one you used to create your GitHub account).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -o -a 100 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "TYPE_YOUR_EMAIL@HERE.com"
```

It will prompt for information. Just press enter until it asks for a **passphrase**.

:warning: When asked for a passphrase, put something you want and that you'll remember. It's a password to protect your private key stored on your hard drive.

:warning: When you type your passphrase, nothing will show up on the screen, **that's normal**. This is a security feature to mask not only your passphrase as a whole but also its length. Just type your passphrase and when you're done, press `ENTER`.

### Giving your public key to GitHub

Now, you will give your **public** key to GitHub.

In your terminal copy-paste the following command:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s write:public_key
```

It will prompt a one time code (####-####) on the screen. Copy it and press `ENTER`, then paste the code in your browser and follow the instructions to **Authorize GitHub**.

Back in the terminal, press `ENTER` and run this:

```bash
gh ssh-key add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

This should return `âœ“ Public key added to your account`. If not, do not hesitate to **contact a manager**.
